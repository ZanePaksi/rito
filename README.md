## The Path Forward
Rito is a fork of my college capstone, Project Fhir Lens, a first iteration at validating FHIR R4 and R3.
Rito is a large refactor of the project to reflect the skills Iâ€™ve gained in the industry. Before moving forward It's neccessary to 
make the codebase easy to implement upon. Testing, testing, testing. That will be the focus for now. Next steps include:

-DSTU2 / R5 / R6 Validation

## Fast FHIR Validation

This Python package provides the tools needed to ensure the validity of Fast Healthcare Interoperability resources (FHIR)

### Usage
To import this package into your code, include this import statement:  
```from rito import rito```

For examples of FHIR R4 resources see, under the JSON section, [HL7 FHIR Downloads](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/downloads.html)

### Limitations

If working with FHIR Servers, some may validate if a codeable concept 'system' url resolves.  
This module does not validate that far. Meaning, false positives for validity are still possible.

### Built With
